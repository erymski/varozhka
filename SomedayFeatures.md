This features would be good to have:
  * domain-specific language for Varozhka. So non-programmer can try his algorithms.
  * "problem finder" - automatically find problem users (users which ratings has highest RMSE)
  * custom indexing mode - I guess sometimes it would be useful to create a custom index(es).
